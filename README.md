# Swift Learning Resources
### A document to keep track of resources I am using (or have used) to learn Swift programming. 
It is also intended to help those getting started on IOS development without any previous Swift experience by sharing my approach.

### Intro
The below is not an in depth list of resources but a list of courses, websites and documents I have used for reference. More will be added as I continue exploring.

Topics that are covered in this document:

- Introduction to Swift Syntax and basic programming concepts
- Familiarity with Xcode (IOS IDE)
- Learning SwiftUI
- Finding help / Answers questions
 

## 1. Swift Syntax
- [SWIFT Website](https://swift.org/) Official swift website. Recommend to visit it to get a background of the language. Worth exploring their [guided tour](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/GuidedTour/GuidedTour.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH2-ID1) before getting started.  
  
- [Learn Swift](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-swift) I took this course on codeacademy to start getting familiar with the language. It has a good mix of explanations anf practical challenges. Some of the concepts apply to other languages, such as declaring variables, arrays, dictionaries, for loops, if else logic, etc. But it was good to revisit.

- [Unwrap APP](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/unwrap/id1440611372) by Paul Hudson. Really engaging app covering a lot of content on Swift along with activities, assessments, tasks, etc. I find this format very easy to stick with, even for short 20-30 mins sessions whenever I have some time.


## 2. Learning SwiftUI
SwiftUI is a relatively new framework released by Apple. Traditionally, ios development has been done via interface builder and story boards and plain Swift on Xcode. If you read a little bit about it, many 
would recommend learning that approach before jumping into SwiftUI. Since SwiftUI doesn't cover all the functionalities yet. So likely, there is a need to combine both in the short term. 
My approach here was to focus on SwiftUI, and only go to UIkit when needed. Since I didn't have any previous background I thought this will be better moving forward rather than having to learn one approach now and
another one in the future (...mind you, learning never stops...). 
  
Resources I used for SwiftUI:

- [SwiftUI tutorials by apple](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui) This is a very well designed guided tour taking readers through the basics of building an app from scratch. Ideally, you would follow along the tutorial while actually coding the app. It touches on a lot of elements and functionalities that you will see in many common apps.
As a side note, It says that it takes about 4.5h to complete the tutorial. My experience here is, if you are new and really want to understand the concepts, repeat each part of the tutorial 2 or 3 times, doing it more independently each time. Overall I can say I spent over 20hrs on this easily. I wouldn't used this as a first resource as it can get relatively complex for beginners.
  
- [SwiftUI by example](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/quick-start/swiftui) This is a great website by Paul Hudson I found with lots of useful resources. I wish I had found it sooner. The **SwiftUI by Example** tutorials combined short and easy-to-follow explanations along with Paul's short explanation videos. Content wise covers most of what is covered on 
the SwiftUI tutorials, but I found this one easier to follow. I'd probably say better to do this one as long with the [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) before the SwiftUI tutorials.
  
- [Learn SwiftUI APP](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/learn-swiftui/id1467598599) I really liked this app. It has more than fifty short tutorials progressing in complexity that you can do directly from your phone. It is a guided tutorial and for me it was a good first introduction. From here I went to the other two resources above.



## 3. Xcode IDE
Xcode is the IDE where apps are code. As of last week, I am currently running the 11.5 version. Resouces I used to get my started:

- [Xcode Apple guide](https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/) Worth browsing through it. It is a very thorough document I still check if I need to.
  
- [Xcode Tutorial for beginners](https://codewithchris.com/xcode-tutorial/) I found this one really helpful, short and easy to follow. Definitely recommend checking it out as well as the whole
website by Chris Ching

## Forums / Help 
After those 3 I felt I was in a good spot to start trying things on my own. When stuck or in doubt (like with any other language really) I use google,  check stackoverflow, apple developer forums and started following some people sharing a lot of interesting content on twitter.

*Some of the profiles mentioned above have websites with excellent courses and tutorials worth exploring.*

Specific to the sport audience I consider [Carlos Balsalobre](https://twitter.com/cbalsalobre) a reference. He has created a lot of very popular and useful [apps](http://www.carlos-balsalobre.com/#apps)

Definitely open to learn from others, how they go about this and what resources they found useful. I hope to update this page as I continue to learn more. Eventually with coding examples as well.
